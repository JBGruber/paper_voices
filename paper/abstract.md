Whose voices are heard?
Existing research indicates that when mainstream news media report about demonstrations, protesters often face delegitimising coverage.
Specifically, I find four main determinants for the use of the different media frames:
(1.) violent protests get more delegitimising coverage, and less legitimising coverage;
(2.) the goal of a protest matters for the kind of reporting it receives, yet relationships between frames and goals are complex and goals overall matter more for legitimising frames;
(3.) protests receive less legitimising coverage from tabloid newspapers than from broadsheet outlets and one of the legitimising frames is used less often by right-wing media --- which means that differences between outlet categories exist but are less pronounced than expected;
and (4.) reports published more recently and longer after the start of an event have a higher chance of containing legitimising framing.
